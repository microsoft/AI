You can `Run All` cells to generate the datasets required to execute the remaining notebooks in this scenario. \n\nTo examine the SPARK data frames constructed, an optional `1a_raw_data_exploring` notebook has been included in the repository and copied to your Azure Databricks Workspace. You must run this data ingestion notebook before running the exploration notebook cells. The exploration notebook details the simulated data sets we used for this predictive maintenance solution example.\n\n## Data sources\n\nThe common data elements for predictive maintenance problems can be summarized as follows:\n\n* Machine features: The features specific to each individual machine, e.g. engine size, make, model, location, installation date.\n* Telemetry data: The operating condition data collected from sensors, e.g. temperature, vibration, operating speeds, pressures.\n* Maintenance history: The repair history of a machine, e.g. maintenance activities or component replacements, this can also include error code or runtime message logs.\n* Failure history: The failure history of a machine or component of interest.\n\nIt is possible that failure history is contained within maintenance history, either as in the form of special error codes or order dates for spare parts. In those cases, failures can be extracted from the maintenance data. Additionally, different business domains may have a variety of other data sources that influence failure patterns which are not listed here exhaustively. These should be identified by consulting the domain experts when building predictive models.\n\nSome examples of above data elements from use cases are:\n    \n**Machine conditions and usage:** Flight routes and times, sensor data collected from aircraft engines, sensor readings from ATM transactions, train events data, sensor readings from wind turbines, elevators and connected cars.\n    \n**Machine features:** Circuit breaker technical specifications such as voltage levels, geolocation or car features such as make, model, engine size, tire types, production facility etc.\n\n**Failure history:** fight delay dates, aircraft component failure dates and types, ATM cash withdrawal transaction failures, train/elevator door failures, brake disk replacement order dates, wind turbine failure dates and circuit breaker command failures.\n\n**Maintenance history:** Flight error logs, ATM transaction error logs, train maintenance records including maintenance type, short description etc. and circuit breaker maintenance records.\n\nGiven the above data sources, the two main data types we observe in predictive maintenance domain are temporal data and static data. Failure history, machine conditions, repair history, usage history are time series indicated by the timestamp of data collection. Machine and operator specific features, are more static, since they usually describe the technical specifications of machines or operator’s properties.\n\nFor this scenario, we use a relatively large-scale data to walk you through the main steps from data ingestion (this Jupyter notebook), feature engineering, model building, and model operationalization and deployment. The code for the entire process is written in PySpark and implemented using Jupyter notebooks within Azure Databricks. We use Azure Databricks scheduled notebooks to simulate creating failure predictions in batch scenarios. \n\n# Step 1: Data Ingestion\n\nThis data aquisiton notebook will download the simulated predictive maintenance data sets from our GitHub data store. We do some preliminary data cleaning and store the results as a Spark data frame on the Azure Cluster for use in the remaining notebook steps of this analysis.\n\n**Note:** This notebook will take about 8-10 minutes to execute all cells, depending on the compute configuration you have setup. Most of this time is spent handling the _telemetry_ data set, which contains about 8.7 million records."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["## Setup our environment by importing required libraries\n\n# Github has been having some timeout issues.
